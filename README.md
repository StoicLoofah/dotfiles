Currently, I mostly work in vim doing web development using Python/Django on remote Ubuntu servers. The files here reflect that.

There are 3 scripts for getting all of this between terminals:
* setup_settings - run this the first time to get on any machine
* push_settings - run this when the repository changes and updates need to be pushed into the environment
* upload_settings - run this when local changes need to be uploaded back to the repository

The settings come largely from a few sources:
1. I use to be an emacs guy
2. ubuntu default settings
3. https://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles
4. various vi tips
