Currently, I mostly do web development on remote servers with:

* Ubuntu
* git
* vim
* Python/Django
* ES6/Node.js
* React
* LESS/CSS

There are 3 scripts for getting all of this between terminals:

* `setup_settings` - run this the first time to get on any machine
* `push_settings` - run this when the repository changes and updates need to be pushed into the environment
* `upload_settings` - run this when local changes need to be uploaded back to the repository

The settings come largely from a few sources:

1. I use to be an emacs guy
2. ubuntu default settings
3. https://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles
4. various vi tips
